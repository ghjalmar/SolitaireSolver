Sitting in an airplane, waiting for it to take off towards Iceland and a long awaited Christmas vacation at my parent's place, I started
thinking about that puzzle in their home that I had never been able to solve. Realizing that I would probably spend some
time out of my holidays working on the puzzle and still not be able to solve it, I decided to try and set up a solver for it in C++ during
the flight home to Iceland. The flight turned out to be a little too short for me to set up the problem and solve it,
but the day after I finished the first version of the solver and was able to solve the board.

The puzzle, or rather the game, that I was so desperate to solve, is called Peg Solitaire (or sometimes English Solitaire).

After having found the first solution, I decided it would be interesting to iterate over all the possible solutions and
see how many they are. It turns out that the possible ways to solve the game are quite many, and the game has even been
the subject of some scholar articles in the field of computer science [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire).


TODO:
 - [x] Let the program run long enough to find all solutions
 - [] Benchmark Apple M1 vs Intel
 - [] Finish this README
